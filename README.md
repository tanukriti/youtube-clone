# 🎬 YouTube Clone
A frontend-focused **YouTube homepage clone** built to practice clean UI layout, responsiveness, and modern HTML/CSS styling. This project was created as part of my learning journey to better understand how real-world websites structure content and design reusable components.

---

## ✨ About the Project
This YouTube clone replicates the **visual layout and user interface** of YouTube’s homepage.  
The goal was not to recreate full functionality, but to focus on:

- Page structure  
- Layout systems (Flexbox & Grid)  
- Visual consistency  
- Responsive design principles  

I built this project while learning frontend development through tutorials and hands-on practice.

## 🎓 Learning Source & Credit
This project was built by following and learning from **SuperSimpleDev**’s frontend tutorials on YouTube.  
The tutorial helped me understand how to break down complex layouts and apply HTML & CSS concepts effectively.
All implementation was done by me as part of my learning process.
